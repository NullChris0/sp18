### IDEA Using Tips
- Open the whole 61b folder which has hws, labs and projs. We need modular programming to step through our assignments.
- Click the IDEA's Project Structure in the menu, import each homework as a single module. Inside module folder, add all subfolders as resource-code folder.
- This way we can run each job even if other jobs contain unfinished code.

### Note
- After clone starter codes from remote skeleton, delete all the skeleton commit locally.
- The repository only contains code files which is NOT in skeleton.
- DON'T add any images or sounds into git, so that autograder will work.
